# eGenix Micro Benchmark

**Easily write micro benchmarks in Python.**

*Please note*: This is still an alpha version of the software. Things are most likely going to change at a higher rate until we've reached a point when a stable release can be made.

## Abstract

This package provides a set of tools for easily writing micro benchmarks in Python.

It builds upon the [pyperf](https://pypi.org/project/pyperf/) package, which is an evolution of the older [pybench](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.6.15/Tools/pybench) tool. pybench was part of Python for a very long time (and was also authored by Marc-Andr√© Lemburg, just like this new package). pyperf, written by Victor Stinner, builds upon the pybench concepts, but comes with more modern ways of doing benchmarking and timing, with the aim of producing more stable results.

Since micro benchmarks will typically test language features which run at a nanosecond scale, it is necessary to repeat the test code several times in order to have the test case run long enough to stand out compared to the timing machinery around it.

This package offers a very elegant way to do this and also provides generic discovery functionality to make writing such benchmarks a breeze.

## Example

Here's an example micro benchmark module (examples/bench_example.py):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import micro_benchmark

### Benchmark function

def bench_match_int():

    # Init
    obj = 1

    # Bench
    match obj:
        case float():
            type = 'float'
        case int():
            type = 'int'
        case _:
            pass

    # Verify
    assert type == 'int'

### CLI interface for benchmark functions in this module

if __name__ == '__main__':
    micro_benchmark.run(namespace=globals())
```

## Concept

The micro benchmark package uses code rewriting to create benchmarking code from simple functions to remove all the overhead you typically need for benchmarking and focus entirely on the benchmark in question.

### Benchmark functions

Each micro benchmark function is separated in parts using standard Python comments with special names and the following meanings:

- The **init** part is run to set up the variables for the main part, the *bench* part. This part is not timed.

- The **bench** part is run inside a loop managed by pyperf lots of times to measure the performance. Since the for-loop used for this incurs some timing overhead as well, the *bench* part is repeated a certain number of times (this is called *iterations* in the context of this package). Per default, the package uses 20 iterations, but this can be changed on a per function basis using a decorator.

- The **verify** part is run after the bench part to check whether the bench part did in fact run correctly and as expected. This part is not timed.

The comment section headers must each start with "`# Init`", "`# Bench`", "`# Verify`" respectively. Text after the initial section indicator is ignored. Code outside these sections is ignored when the function is run as a micro benchmark; it still runs when the function is called normally.

### Benchmark runner

To run these functions via the command line, you call the `micro_benchmark.run()` function to have the package search for benchmark functions and run them.

The first argument to this function has to be a namespace object (one which has an `.items()` method or a `.__dict__` attribute). Easiest is to provide the module globals() to have the function search the local module for benchmark functions.

The second optional parameter provides the name prefix to search for. This defaults to "bench_" and is normally not needed.

## Running a benchmark

Invoking the benchmark is easy. Simply run it with Python:

```
python3 examples/bench_example.py
```

The benchmark will take all the command line arguments pyperf supports, in addition to these extra ones added by the egenix-micro-benchmarks package:

- `--mb-filter=<regexp>`
  Only run those benchmark functions which match the given regular expression. The matching is done as a substring match, so e.g. using `--mb-filter="match"` will match the function in the example module.

The output will look something like this:

```
.....................
bench_match_int: Mean +- std dev: 105 ns +- 10 ns
```

giving you the time it tool to run a single iteration of the bench part, together with an indication how reliable this reading is, by providing the standard deviation of the timings.

In some cases, pyperf may warn you about unstable results. Benchmarking typically works best on quiet machines which don't have anything much else to do.

# Public API

`micro_benchmark.run(namespace, prefix='bench_', filters=None)`

> Run all benchmark functions found in namespace.
>
> *namespace* can be an object with an '`.items()`' method (e.g. the
globals() dictionary) or a `.__dict__` attribute (e.g. a module,
package, class, etc.).
>
> *prefix* is the prefix name of benchmark functions to look for
(defaults to '`bench_`').
>
> *filters* may be given as a list of regular expression to limit the
number of functions to run.  The expressions are OR-joined. If the
parameter is not given, the command line argument `--mb-filter` is used.
If this is missing as well, no filtering takes place.

`micro_benchmark.configure(iterations=None, name=None)`

> Decorator to provide additional configuration for a benchmark function.
>
> *iterations* can be set to override the default for this function
(which is 20)
>
> *name* can be given to provide a more verbose name for the function.
The name is used by pyperf when generating output and for recording the
results in the JSON results file. It defaults to the function's name.

# Development

## Preparing the venv

In order to prepare the virtual env needed for the package to run, edit the `Makefile` to your liking and then run:

```
make install-venv
source env.sh # for bash
source env.csh # for C-shell
make install-packages
```

(or use any other virtual env tool you like :-))

## Create a release

- Install the dev requirements
```
make install-dev-packages
```
- Make sure you update the version number in `micro_benchmark/__init__.py`
- Create a distribution and upload to TestPyPI
```
make create-dist
make test-upload
```
- Check release on TestPyPI and try downloading the package from there
  - Special attention should be paid to the contents of the .tar.gz file
  - This should contain all necessary files to build the package
- Publish to PyPI:
```
make prod-upload
```
- Tag the release
```
make tag-release
```
- Create Github release based on the tag
- Send out release emails

## Roadmap

### Short-term

- [x] Turn into a package
- [x] Release as a PyPI package
- [ ] Add more documentation and convert to MkDocs
- [ ] Add tests

### Mid-term

- [ ] Add ways to easily use these benchmarks in performance tests
- [ ] Add a whole set of micro benchmarks (e.g. the ones from pybench)
  - May be better to do this as a separate package
